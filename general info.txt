If git says it has untracked files, that means those files are not inclded in any version history. To fix this, we need to pick which of what we want
in our version history. to do that, use "git add".
A version in git is known as a "Commit"

lets say we forgot a file and wanted it in a previous commit, we can use "git add .", and then git commit -m "version1" --amend
